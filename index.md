## Calculating multi-period expected geometric returns

This post illustrates a method used by actuaries to estimate multi-period geometric returns for a diversified portfolio.

The problem is that a diversified portfolio will have lower volatility than the weighted average volatility of the constituents. Consequently, the lower volatility needs to be reflected in estimating the portfolio geometric return.  The portfolio geometric return will be higher than the weighted average geometric returns of the components depending on the degree of volatility reduction from the components.
